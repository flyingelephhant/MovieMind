## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end movie rating prediction system that can:
- Predict IMDb ratings based on director, actors, genres, and duration.
- Handle cold start problems (new directors/actors) using TMDb API.
- Provide fuzzy matching for better user input handling.
- Recommend similar movies based on selected genres.

The system helps users get an estimated rating and recommendations even if proper historical data for the movie is not available.
