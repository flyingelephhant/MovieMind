# 🎥 MovieMind - Intelligent Movie Rating & Recommendation System

Welcome to the **MovieMind** project!  
In this project, we use machine learning techniques to predict IMDb ratings for both new and existing movies and provide personalized movie recommendations based on genre similarity.

## 📖 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end movie rating prediction system that can:

- ⭐ Predict IMDb ratings based on director, actors, genres, and duration.
- 🌟 Handle cold start problems (new directors/actors) using TMDb API.
- 🧩 Provide fuzzy matching for better user input handling.
- 🎯 Recommend similar movies based on selected genres.

The system helps users get an estimated rating and recommendations even if proper historical data for the movie is not available.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for `.ipynb` files)

Required Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `requests`
- `thefuzz`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `pickle-mixin`

### Installation

To install all required libraries, open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🖥️ Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Movie_Rating.ipynb`) or run the Python script.
2. Provide the following inputs when prompted:

   - 🎬 Director's name
   - 🎭 Actor 1 name
   - 🎭 Actor 2 name
   - 🎞️ Genres (comma-separated)
   - ⏱️ Movie duration in minutes

3. The system will:

   - ⭐ Predict the IMDb rating
   - ✅ Provide a recommendation category
   - 🎯 Suggest similar movies based on genre

---

## 🔍 Project Details

### 📦 Data Collection

We use a cleaned dataset `Movie_Dataset_p.csv`, which contains:

- 🎥 Movie titles
- 🎬 Director names
- 🎭 Actor names
- 🎞️ Genres
- ⭐ IMDb ratings
- ⏱️ Runtime
- 🗣️ Language

For missing or unknown directors/actors, the system fetches data from **TMDb API** to improve accuracy.

---

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Cleaning whitespace and special characters
- Standardizing text cases (lowercasing names)
- Filling missing runtime and language values
- Cleaning genres and actor/director names

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed:

- Visualized IMDb score distributions
- Analyzed impact of duration on IMDb scores
- Correlation between director's average rating and IMDb score
- Created visual plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn

---

### ⚙️ Feature Engineering

- Calculated average ratings for directors and actors
- One-hot encoded movie genres using `MultiLabelBinarizer`
- Built feature vectors for model training

---

### 🤖 Modeling

We trained multiple regression models:

- *Linear Regression*
- *Random Forest Regressor*
- *XGBoost Regressor*
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
- *Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)*

✅ The final selected model is **Random Forest Regressor** for its high accuracy.

Models and preprocessing data are saved using **Pickle** for easy deployment.

---

### 📈 Evaluation

Model performance evaluated using:

- 📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- 📈 R² Score

The Random Forest model performed the best in predicting IMDb ratings.

---

### 🎯 Recommendation System

Based on genre similarity, we use **cosine similarity** to recommend similar movies.

The system outputs the top 5 recommended movies, along with:

- 🎞️ Genres
- ⭐ IMDb scores

---

## ✅ Conclusion

In this project, we successfully built an end-to-end movie rating prediction and recommendation system.

We implemented:

- ✅ Data cleaning and feature engineering
- 🧩 Robust input handling with fuzzy matching
- 🌟 Cold-start problem handling via TMDb API
- 🔮 Machine learning models to predict ratings
- 🎯 Genre-based movie recommendation engine
